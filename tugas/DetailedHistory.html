        <h2>Detailed history</h2>
        <p>The word strawberry is coined from 'strew" berries about the plants and
            thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are
            not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.
            the seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There
            are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are
            non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potasium
            (Roger).

        <p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,
            stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries
            were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,
            and exellece. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is
            at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very
            well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
